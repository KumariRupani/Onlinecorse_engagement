# Online Course Engagement Project

This project models the engagement of users in an online learning platform. It includes a database that tracks user interactions with courses, quizzes, and overall engagement metrics. The database stores information about users, courses, their engagement with those courses (e.g., completion rates, time spent), and quiz scores.

## Project Overview

The database contains the following tables:

1. **Users**: Stores information about the platformâ€™s users, such as user names, emails, and registration dates.
2. **Courses**: Stores details about courses offered on the platform, including course name and category.
3. **Engagement**: Tracks user interactions with courses, including whether they completed a course, time spent on the course, videos watched, and quizzes taken.
4. **Quizzes**: Stores the quiz scores for users within specific courses.

The project also provides several SQL queries to analyze user engagement and course performance, helping platform administrators and educators understand which courses are most popular, which users are most engaged, and other important insights.

## Features

- **Sample Data**: Pre-populated with sample data for users, courses, engagements, and quizzes to simulate real-world interactions.
- **SQL Queries**: Several queries to analyze user engagement, course completion rates, and quiz performance, such as identifying the most completed courses, users with the highest quiz scores, and courses with the most time spent.
- **Insights**: Analyze data based on course categories, time spent, and quiz performance.
